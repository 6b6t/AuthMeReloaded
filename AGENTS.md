# Agent Guidelines for 6b6t AuthMeReloaded

## Rollout dry runs and logging

Before every deployment or rollout, perform a dry run and review verbose logs of the exact planned changes.
This applies to artifact uploads, staged replacements, configuration changes, migrations, restarts, releases, and pushes that trigger automatic deployments.

- Verify the target environment, cluster context, namespace, service, and destination paths before any mutation.
- Record the current state and a complete artifact inventory, including filenames, plugin identities, versions, and checksums where applicable.
- Build one explicit change plan. List every file or resource to create, replace, remove, migrate, or restart.
- Use exact artifact names and paths for replacements and removals. Do not use broad globs or shared name prefixes.
- Keep related plugins distinct. `AuthMe*.jar` also matches AuthMeVelocity and must never select AuthMeReloaded files for removal.
- Use the tool's native dry-run or plan mode and verbose output when available. Review the resulting diff before applying it.
- If no native dry run exists, produce a non-mutating preview from the same selection logic and explicit change plan.
- For custom scripts, provide dry-run and verbose modes. Both modes must use the same plan as the real operation.
- Log each planned and applied action with its exact target and reason. Include before-and-after identities, versions, and checksums where applicable.
- Redact secrets and personal data before output. Do not print whole credential-bearing configurations or enable shell tracing around secrets.
- Stop if the preview includes unrelated changes, unexpected removals, ambiguous targets, or unverified artifacts. Correct the plan before proceeding.
- Prepare rollback copies outside active and staged artifact directories before replacing or removing artifacts.
- Apply only the reviewed plan. If the target state changes, repeat the dry run before applying it.
- Compare complete inventories after applying the plan. Exclude only the exact intended filenames, never a shared prefix.
- Verify unrelated artifacts remain present and unchanged. Account explicitly for documented self-updating artifacts.
- Verify the affected user flow after rollout. Healthy pods and successful authentication alone do not prove cross-plugin handoffs work.
- For authentication changes, verify login, the message to the proxy, and transfer from the login server to the destination.
- Report the dry-run result, applied changes, rollback location, and live verification. Preserve existing user authorization requirements.
